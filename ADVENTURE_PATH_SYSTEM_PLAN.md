# Adventure Path System - Implementation Plan

**Feature**: Mario-style World Map with Boss Levels for Nextcloud Quest  
**Created**: 2025-01-10  
**Status**: Planning Complete - Ready for Implementation  

## üéØ Feature Overview

A procedurally generated 2D side-scrolling world map (Mario Bros 3 style) organized into themed worlds with boss levels. Players navigate through levels that correspond to specific task objectives, building toward epic boss challenges that are the same for all players globally.

## üìã Design Decisions (From User Requirements)

### Core Mechanics
- ‚úÖ **Path Structure**: Diamond patterns with reconvergence points, organized into 8-12 level worlds
- ‚úÖ **Movement**: Mario Bros 3 style - forward progression only, no backtracking
- ‚úÖ **Objectives**: Mixed complexity (simple ‚Üí complex ‚Üí boss levels with epic challenges)
- ‚úÖ **Failure Handling**: Auto-regenerate objectives if tasks become unavailable
- ‚úÖ **Visual Style**: 2D side-view scrolling map with themed levels and boss castles
- ‚úÖ **Map Visibility**: Full visibility of current world, boss castle visible at end
- ‚úÖ **Branching**: Smart branching (2-4 paths) based on available task types
- ‚úÖ **Integration**: User choice between normal dashboard mode and adventure mode

### World & Boss System
- ‚úÖ **World Length**: 8-12 levels per world (like Mario)
- ‚úÖ **Boss Challenges**: Mixed epic challenges, more difficult than regular levels
- ‚úÖ **Mini-Boss Placement**: Variable placement within each world
- ‚úÖ **Boss Consistency**: Same objectives globally for all players
- ‚úÖ **Future Feature**: Seasonal bosses (planned for later versions)
