### Task Completion Methods

#### With Nextcloud Tasks (Recommended)
- Tasks completed in the Nextcloud Tasks app automatically award XP
- Priority levels determine bonus XP (High = +10, Medium = +5, Low = +0)

#### Manual Task Entry
- Use the "Complete Task" button in the Quest dashboard
- Enter task description and select priority
- XP is calculated and awarded instantly

### XP Calculation
```
Base XP: 10
Priority Bonus: 0-10 (based on task priority)
Streak Multiplier: 1.0x to 2.0x (10% per consecutive day, capped at 2x)
Total XP = (Base XP + Priority Bonus) √ó Streak Multiplier
```

### Level Progression
- **Level 1**: 0 XP
- **Level 2**: 100 XP  
- **Level 3**: 250 XP
- **Level 4**: 475 XP
- And so on... (exponential growth using `100 * 1.5^(level-1)`)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Quest app not showing XP for completed tasks**
- Ensure the Tasks app is installed and working
- Check that tasks are marked as "completed" not just "done"
- Verify the Quest app has proper database permissions

**Streaks not updating correctly**
- Streaks reset at midnight in your server's timezone
- You have until midnight the next day (grace period) to maintain streaks
- Check background jobs are running (`occ background:cron`)

**Achievements not unlocking**
- Achievement checking runs when tasks are completed
- Some achievements require specific conditions (time of day, etc.)
- Check the notification settings if you're missing unlock notifications

**Performance issues**
- The app is optimized for thousands of tasks and users
- Database queries use proper indexing
- Background jobs handle maintenance tasks efficiently
